## Closures

Closures are functions that have access to the outer function's scope even after the outer function has returned.

## Promises and Async/Await

Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. `async` and `await` make it easier to work with promises.

## Prototypes and Inheritance

JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance. Understanding how prototypes work is crucial for mastering JavaScript.

## Modules

Modules allow you to break your code into reusable pieces. ES6 introduced a standard for modules in JavaScript.

## Event Loop

The event loop is what allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, despite being single-threaded.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where you build programs using pure functions, avoiding shared state and mutable data.

Happy learning!
